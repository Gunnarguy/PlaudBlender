FAQ

How accurate are the AI summaries?
Our summaries are generated by advanced LLMs and demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in capturing key information. However, as with any AI system, we recommend reviewing critical details for precision, as complex or nuanced discussions may occasionally result in minor inaccuracies.
What scenarios is AI Summary best suited for?
AI Summary is highly effective for a wide range of applications, including summarizing business meetings, academic lectures, customer support calls, interviews, and personal voice memos. Its versatility makes it a valuable tool in any context where concise record-keeping is essential.
Can I customize the summary output format?
Yes. You can define custom prompts to instruct the AI on how to structure the summary. This allows you to specify the desired format, content to include, and the overall tone, giving you full control over the final output.
How does AI Summary handle different languages?
The summarization capability is tied to the language of the transcription. As long as the audio is accurately transcribed in a supported language, AI Summary can process the text to generate a summary in that same language.
